ü§ñ Bot Battler Army
This is a React app for managing a collection of bots. You can sort, filter, delete, and build your own Bot Army ‚Äî but with a twist! You can only add one bot per class to your army at a time.

‚ú® Features
View All Bots: A list of all available bots is displayed on load.

Sort Bots: You can sort bots by:

Health

Damage

Armor

In ascending or descending order

You can also restore the original arrangement

Filter Bots: Filter bots by their class, like Medic, Support, etc. Click again to restore the full list.

Add to Army: Add bots to your personal army.

Only one bot per class can be added at a time.

If a bot of a class already exists in your army, a message is shown.

Remove from Army: Bots can be removed and returned to the main collection.

Permanent Delete: Bots can be permanently deleted from the server.

Bot Details: Click on any bot to view extra details, such as:

Catchphrase

Creation and update time

üß† How It Works
Main State:

bots: The current visible bot collection

originalBots: The full original list (used for restoring)

army: The bots currently in your army

Sorting:

When you click sort, the bots list is sorted

You also see a message telling you what kind of sort was applied

Clicking the sort button again restores the original list

Filtering:

Clicking a class filters the list to only bots of that class

Clicking again restores the full list

Messages:

Temporary messages appear for:

Sorting

Filtering

üõ†Ô∏è How to Run
Make sure you have the bot server running on http://localhost:3000/bots.

Then:

bash
Copy
Edit
npm install
npm start
The app should open at http://localhost:3000 (or another port if 3000 is in use).

 Extra Notes
Bots are fetched from a JSON server (http://localhost:3000/bots).
